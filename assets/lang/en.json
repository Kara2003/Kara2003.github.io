      "description": "Low order harmonics of most instruments, generally viewed as the bass presence range. Boosting a signal around 300 Hz adds clarity to the bass and lower-stringed instruments. Too much boost around 500 Hz can make higher-frequency instruments sound muffled."

      "name": "Midrange",
      "width": "20%",
      "description": "The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn-like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue."

      "name": "Upper Mids",
      "width": "10%",
      "description": "The high midrange is responsible for the attack on percussive and rhythm instruments. If boosted, this range can add presence. However, too much boost around the 3 kHz range can cause listening fatigue."

      "name": "Presence",
      "width": "5.9%",
      "description": "The presence range is responsible for the clarity and definition of a sound. Over-boosting can cause an irritating, harsh sound. Cutting in this range makes the sound more distant and transparent."
